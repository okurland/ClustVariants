The retrieval merits of using multiple queries representing the same
information need have long been demonstrated. We present the first
study of utilizing multiple queries in cluster-based document
retrieval; that is, using information induced from clusters of similar
documents to rank documents. Specifically, we propose {\em retrieval
  templates} that adapt {\em some} retrieval method, originally
devised for a single query, to leverage multiple queries. The
adaptations operate at the query, document list and feature
levels. Retrieval methods are instantiated from the templates by
selecting, for example, the clustering algorithm and the cluster-based
retrieval method. Empirical evaluation attests to the merits of the
retrieval templates with respect to very strong baselines: state-of-the-art cluster-based
retrieval with a single query and highly effective fusion of document lists retrieved
for multiple queries. In addition, we present interesting
findings about the impact of the effectiveness of queries used to
represent an information need on (i) {\em cluster hypothesis}
test results, (ii) percentage of relevant documents in clusters of similar documents, and (iii) effectiveness of state-of-the-art cluster-based retrieval methods.
