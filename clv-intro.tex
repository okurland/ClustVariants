\section{introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The cluster hypothesis for ad hoc retrieval is: ``{\em closely
associated documents tend to be relevant to the same requests}''
\cite{Jardine+Rijsbergen:71a}. The operational interpretation of the
hypothesis is that relevant documents are more similar to each
other than to non-relevant documents. A few tests were designed
and applied to study the extent to which the
hypothesis holds \cite{Jardine+Rijsbergen:71a,Voorhees:85a,elHamdouchi+Willett:87a,Crestani+Wu:06a,Smucker+Allan:09a,Raiber+Kurland:14c}. Furthermore,
several inter-document similarity measures were devised to improve
the cluster hypothesis test results
\cite{Tombros+Villa+Rijsbergen:02a,Raiber+al:15a}. In addition, a ``reversed''
cluster hypothesis was formulated stating that documents co-relevant to queries should be similar \cite{Fuhr+al:12a}.

On the operational side, the cluster hypothesis has driven a huge body of
work on document retrieval methods that utilize information induced
from clusters of similar documents. There are two main classes of
cluster-based document retrieval methods \cite{Kurland+Lee:04a}. The
first includes methods that rank document clusters by the presumed
percentage of relevant documents they contain; then, the cluster
ranking is transformed to document ranking
\cite{Jardine+Rijsbergen:71a,Croft:80a,Voorhees:85a,elHamdouchi+Willett:89a,Tombros+Villa+Rijsbergen:02a,Kurland+Lee:04a,Liu+Croft:04a,Kurland+Lee:06a,Liu+Croft:06a,Liu+Croft:06b,Liu+Croft:08a,Kurland+Domshlak:08a,Kurland+Krikon:11a,Raiber+Kurland:13a}. A
document retrieval method based on supervised ranking of document clusters was the best
performing in the Web track of TREC 2013 \cite{Thompson+al:13a}.

One of the main motivations for pursuing the cluster ranking task is
the {\em optimal cluster} phenomenon
\cite{Cutting+al:92a,Tombros+Villa+Rijsbergen:02a,Liu+Croft:06b,Kurland+Domshlak:08a}:
if the documents most highly ranked by an initial search are
clustered, there are some resultant clusters that contain a very high
percentage of relevant documents; the cluster with the highest percentage is termed ``the optimal cluster''. Positioning the
constituent documents of the optimal cluster at the top ranks of the
final result list results in precision at top ranks which is
dramatically better than that of document-based retrieval methods \cite{Tombros+Villa+Rijsbergen:02a,Liu+Croft:06b,Kurland+Domshlak:08a}. A
case in point, for a standard TREC corpus, the average precision at
top five ranks (p@5) that results from identifying the optimal cluster
can reach ~$0.8$ in comparison to $~0.46$ attained by a standard language model
retrieval \cite{Kurland+Domshlak:08a}\footnote{These performance numbers were reported for TREC's AP corpus with
  the titles of topics 51-150 serving as queries \cite{Kurland+Domshlak:08a}.}.

The second class of cluster-based document retrieval methods includes those that enrich the document representation with information induced from the clusters \cite{Singhal+Pereira:99a,Kurland+Lee:04a,Liu+Croft:04a,Kurland:09a}; e.g., in the language modeling framework, document language models can be smoothed using cluster language models \cite{Kurland+Lee:04a,Liu+Croft:04a,Kurland:09a}. The motivation is to reduce the potential vocabulary mismatch between the query and relevant documents by enriching a document representation with information induced from similar documents.

As in the vast majority of work on ad hoc document retrieval, work on
the cluster hypothesis and cluster-based document retrieval was
confined to the standard setting of a single query representing an
information need. However, it has long been acknowledged that using
for retrieval multiple queries that represent the same information
need is of merit \cite{Belkin+al:93a,Belkin+al:95a}. Recently, there
has been a growing renewed interest in the multiple-queries retrieval
setting
\cite{bailey2016uqv100,bailey2017retrieval,bc17-adcs,Thomas+al:17a,Benham+al:19a,Liu+al:19a,Lu+al:19a,Zendel+al:19a}, with solid evidence to its operational feasibility and importance; specifically, it was recently shown that
query variations automatically selected from a query log of a commercial search engine can be, on average, effective to the same extent as human generated query
variations \cite{Liu+al:19a}. 

Previous work on using multiple queries for retrieval has focused on
different approaches to fusing the retrieved document lists 
\cite{Belkin+al:93a,Belkin+al:95a,Pickens+al:08a,bailey2017retrieval,bc17-adcs} and
on using the queries for relevance modeling (query expansion)
\cite{Lu+al:19a}. In this paper, we address the multiple-queries setting in the cluster-based document retrieval realm. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies of cluster-based document retrieval or the cluster hypothesis with multiple queries.

We propose a suite of {\em retrieval templates} that adapt existing cluster-based retrieval approaches, which were originally designed to work with a single query, to use multiple queries representing the same information need. We use the term ``templates'' as these can be instantiated in various ways to yield specific retrieval methods; e.g., by selecting the clustering algorithm and the specific cluster-based retrieval method to adapt. The adaptations can be applied for a large number of cluster-based retrieval methods, whether these are based on cluster ranking or on enriching document representations using cluster-based information. The adaptation techniques operate at the query level, document-list level and feature level.

Extensive empirical evaluation attests to the clear merits of the
proposed retrieval templates. The resultant methods substantially outperform state-of-the-art cluster-based
retrieval using a single query as is standard. The performance of our methods also substantially 
transcends that of the strongest baselines reported in the literature for utilizing multiple
queries for retrieval.

In addition, we test the cluster hypothesis with queries of varying
effectiveness and arrive to an interesting finding: for badly
performing queries the hypothesis can hold to a larger extent than for
highly effective queries. That is, using highly effective queries for retrieval yields result lists
where relevant documents are less similar to each other than in result lists retrieved for
poorly performing queries. This finding helps to explain another important, and somewhat striking, finding that has emerged in our analysis: state-of-the-art
cluster-based retrieval methods can fall short with respect to
standard document retrieval when using highly effective
queries. However, their merits are quite emphasized when using queries
of moderate/poor effectiveness.

Additional important finding in our analysis is that the percentage of 
relevant documents in an optimal cluster is dramatically affected by query effectiveness. A case in
point, the optimal cluster numbers reported in the past for TREC's
topic titles \cite{Liu+Croft:06b,Kurland+Domshlak:08a} can be dramatically different for different queries representing the same information needs (topics). 



Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, of the
  cluster-based document retrieval realm in a retrieval setting with
  multiple queries representing the same information need.
\item We study the cluster hypothesis with queries of varying
  effectiveness and empirically show that for highly effective queries
  the test holds to a lower degree than for moderately and poorly
  performing queries.
\item We empirically demonstrate that the relative effectiveness of state-of-the-art cluster-based document retrieval methods with respect to standard document-based retrieval methods can be dramatically affected by the effectiveness of the query used.
\item We propose a suite of retrieval templates that allow to adapt
  various cluster-based retrieval methods to utilize multiple queries. The resultant effectiveness
  of retrieval methods instantiated from these templates transcends
  the state-of-the-art in (i) cluster-based retrieval using a single query and (ii) prior work on utilizing multiple queries for retrieval.
