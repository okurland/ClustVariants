The generative theory for relevance and its operational manifestation
--- the relevance model --- are based on the premise that a single
query is used to represent an information need for retrieval.
In this work, we extend the theory and devise novel techniques for
relevance modeling using as set of query variations representing the
same information need.
Our new approach is based on fusion at the term level, the model
level, or the document-list level.
We theoretically analyze the connections between these methods and
provide empirical support of their equivalence using TREC datasets.
Specifically, our new approach of inducing relevance models from
multiple query variations substantially outperforms relevance model
induction from a single query which is the standard practice.
Our approach also outperforms fusion over multiple query variations,
which is currently one of the best known baselines for several
commonly used test collections.
